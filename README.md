# Burger
https://immense-gorge-21388.herokuapp.com/

A burger logger web application that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, then uses Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### How It Works
* Burgers is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to "devour".
* When a user submits a burger name, the app will display the burger that's to be devoured on the left.
* Each burger in the "To Devour" column also has a button to eat it. When the user clicks the "devour" icon, the burger will move to the right side of the page--"Devoured" column.
* Burgers on the right side of the page have a delete button (a trashcan) to remove it from view.
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, ORM, MVC
